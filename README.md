# Schedule my Day

## Description
This app is designed to allow the user to plan out their day using a scheduler. This website allows the user to input different plans on different time frames. Once they save the note they made for the time frame, it saves on the local storage. If the user decides to refresh the page, the information they inputed will still display.
